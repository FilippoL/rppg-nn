# rppg-nnet: An end to end system for remote Heart Rate detection through spatial-temporal maps.

The project in this repository has been finalised during my final MSc thesis in Artificial Intelligence at Utrecht University, in collaboration with [Teoresi](https://www.teoresigroup.com/).

## Download

Clone or download this repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:FilippoL/rppg-nn.git
```

## Usage

Download the model weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ahb1ULjQ2onkdW_cBcEDCGM_cXW3hzxu/view?usp=sharing).

After having set the right path to the model you should be able to run the real_time_evaluate.py script.
